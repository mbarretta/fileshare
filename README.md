# Brushpass

Brushpass is a self-hosted secure file transfer tool. Authenticated users upload files to GCP Cloud Storage and receive a shareable URL plus a one-time-shown download token. Anyone with the URL and token can download the file — no account required. Files can have optional TTLs with active cleanup. An admin panel provides file management, expiration control, download metrics, and user management.

## Chainguard security stack

Brushpass uses Chainguard throughout the container and dependency supply chain.

### Base images

The Docker build uses two Chainguard Container images:

```dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/barretta/node:25-dev AS builder   # build stage — includes gcc, make, python3 for native addons
FROM cgr.dev/barretta/node:25-slim AS runner   # runtime stage — minimal, distroless-style
```

Both images are rebuilt nightly from source with zero known CVEs at release time and ship with Sigstore signatures and SBOMs. The multi-stage build means the final runtime image contains only the Node.js runtime and application files — no compiler toolchain, no package manager, no shell.

### npm dependencies (Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript)

All 9 production npm dependencies are available in the [Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/libraries/javascript/overview/) registry at their exact pinned versions:

| Package | Version | In Chainguard registry |
|---|---|---|
| `next` | 16.2.1 | ✅ |
| `react` / `react-dom` | 19.2.4 | ✅ |
| `better-sqlite3` | 12.8.0 | ✅ |
| `@google-cloud/storage` | 7.19.0 | ✅ |
| `next-auth` | 5.0.0-beta.30 | ✅ |
| `bcryptjs` | 3.0.3 | ✅ |
| `busboy` | 1.6.0 | ✅ |
| `@noble/hashes` | 2.0.1 | ✅ |

Chainguard Libraries rebuilds every package from its original source repository in a hardened SLSA L2 build environment rather than downloading pre-compiled artifacts from the public npm registry. Each package ships with Sigstore signatures and SLSA provenance attestations. This eliminates the class of supply-chain attacks where malware is injected into a registry artifact after the legitimate source code was written — [~99% of known malicious npm packages by that vector](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/mitigating-malware-in-the-npm-ecosystem-with-chainguard-libraries).

You can verify any installed package with `chainctl libraries verify $(npm config get cache)`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (tested on 20 LTS and 22)
- **npm** (comes with Node)
- A **GCP project** with a Cloud Storage bucket
- GCS credentials — either Application Default Credentials (ADC) or a service account JSON key

---

## Quick start (local dev)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (run from the repo root)
npm install

# 2. Copy and fill in environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — see Configuration reference below

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will be redirected to `/login`.

> **Note:** The dev server uses Turbopack by default. If you hit eval() errors running inside a GSD or similar agent environment, use `npm run start` after a production build instead — the production server does not use eval().

---

## Configuration reference

All configuration is via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development. In production, set these in your process environment or secrets manager — do not commit `.env` to version control.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GCS_BUCKET` | Name of the GCS bucket where uploaded files are stored. **Required at startup** — the server will not start without it. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Secret used to sign Auth.js JWT session tokens. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Must be the same across all instances if you run multiple. |
| `AUTH_URL` | The canonical base URL of your deployment, e.g. `https://files.example.com`. Used by Auth.js v5 to construct redirect URLs and validate origins. Required in production. |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to the SQLite database file, e.g. `./data/fileshare.db`. The directory is created automatically. Defaults to `./data/fileshare.db` if unset. |
| `CLEANUP_SECRET` | Bearer token that protects `GET /api/cleanup`. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Keep this secret — anyone with it can trigger bulk deletion. |

### GCS credentials

The app uses the Google Cloud Node.js client which supports two credential modes:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Path to a service account JSON key file, e.g. `/etc/secrets/sa.json`. If set, this takes precedence over ADC. |
| *(none)* | If `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not set, the client uses [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials). On GCE/GKE/Cloud Run this is the instance service account. Locally, run `gcloud auth application-default login`. |

### OIDC / SSO (optional)

All three variables must be set together. Setting only some of them disables OIDC and logs a warning at startup.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER` | OIDC issuer URL, e.g. `https://accounts.google.com` or `https://your-org.okta.com`. Must expose a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint. |
| `AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID from your IdP application registration. |
| `AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret from your IdP application registration. |
| `AUTH_OIDC_ADMIN_DOMAIN` | Email domain whose users automatically receive `["upload", "admin"]` on first OIDC sign-in (e.g. `example.com`). Optional — leave unset to require manual permission grants. |

### Legacy / compatibility

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Older Auth.js v4 name for `AUTH_URL`. Accepted for compatibility. Prefer `AUTH_URL` in new deployments. |

---

## GCS setup

### 1. Create a bucket

```bash
gcloud storage buckets create gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME \
  --location=US \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

The bucket should **not** be public. The app streams files server-side — clients never access GCS directly.

### 2. IAM permissions

The identity running the app needs the following role on the bucket:

```
roles/storage.objectAdmin
```

This covers read, write, delete, and rename (copy + delete) operations. If you prefer least-privilege:

| Permission | Used for |
|---|---|
| `storage.objects.create` | Upload |
| `storage.objects.get` | Download streaming |
| `storage.objects.delete` | Admin delete, cleanup job, rename |
| `storage.objects.update` | Rename (rewrite metadata) |

### 3. Authentication options

**Option A — Application Default Credentials (recommended for GCP-hosted deployments)**

On GCE, GKE, or Cloud Run, attach a service account to the instance/pod/service with the permissions above. No credential file needed — the client library picks them up automatically.

For local development:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
# or
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=sa@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Option B — Service account key file**

```bash
# Create a service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create fileshare \
  --display-name="Fileshare app"

# Grant bucket access
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME \
  --member="serviceAccount:fileshare@YOUR_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"

# Create and download a key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create sa.json \
  --iam-account=fileshare@YOUR_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Then set in your environment:
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/sa.json
```

### 4. Changing the bucket

Update `GCS_BUCKET` in your environment and restart. Files already in the old bucket are **not** migrated automatically — they remain in the old bucket and downloads will fail for those files. If you need to migrate, copy the objects with `gcloud storage cp` before switching.

---

## OIDC / SSO setup

The app uses a generic OIDC provider — any IdP that exposes an OpenID Connect discovery document at `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration` will work. Tested with Google, Okta, and Keycloak. Should work with any compliant IdP (Azure AD, Auth0, Dex, etc.).

### 1. Register a callback URL with your IdP

The redirect URI to register is:

```
{AUTH_URL}/api/auth/callback/oidc
```

For example: `https://files.example.com/api/auth/callback/oidc`

### 2. Set the three env vars

```bash
AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER=https://accounts.google.com     # or your IdP's issuer URL
AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

When all three are set, the login page shows a **"Sign in with SSO"** button below the username/password form.

### 3. How OIDC users get permissions

OIDC sign-in upserts a user record in SQLite (`auth_provider='oidc'`, no password hash). By default new OIDC users receive **no permissions** — they can access download pages but not upload or admin routes.

Two ways to grant permissions:

**Option A — Domain auto-promotion (recommended for internal deployments)**

Set `AUTH_OIDC_ADMIN_DOMAIN` to your organization's email domain:

```bash
AUTH_OIDC_ADMIN_DOMAIN=example.com
```

Users whose email matches that domain automatically receive `["upload", "admin"]` on their **first** OIDC sign-in. Subsequent logins do not change permissions — so permissions can be downgraded manually without being re-granted on next login.

**Option B — Manual grant via admin UI**

Leave `AUTH_OIDC_ADMIN_DOMAIN` unset. After the user signs in once (creating their record), go to `/admin/users`, find the user, and assign permissions.

### 4. IdP-specific notes

**Google:**
- Issuer: `https://accounts.google.com`
- Configure an OAuth 2.0 Web Application credential in Google Cloud Console
- Add the callback URL to "Authorized redirect URIs"

**Okta:**
- Issuer: `https://your-org.okta.com` (or a custom authorization server URL)
- Create an OIDC Web Application
- Add the callback URL to "Sign-in redirect URIs"
- Enable "Client Credentials" or "Authorization Code" grant type

**Keycloak:**
- Issuer: `https://your-keycloak/realms/your-realm`
- Create a Client with "openid-connect" protocol
- Set Access Type to "confidential"
- Add the callback URL to "Valid Redirect URIs"

**Partial config warning:** If only 1 or 2 of the three OIDC vars are set, the server logs a warning at startup and disables the OIDC button entirely. It does not fail to start.

---

## First admin user

There is no seed script. The first admin user must be created via the API before any user can log in to the admin UI.

**Bootstrap the first admin user:**

```bash
# Generate a bcrypt hash of your chosen password
node -e "
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
bcrypt.hash('your-password', 10).then(h => console.log(h));
"

# Insert directly into SQLite
sqlite3 /path/to/your/fileshare.db \
  "INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, permissions) VALUES ('admin', '<paste-hash>', '[\"admin\",\"upload\"]');"
```

After that, log in at `/login` and use the admin UI at `/admin/users` to create additional users.

**Alternatively, use the API directly** (if you can authenticate somehow — e.g. via a temporary user created in the DB):

```bash
curl -X POST https://files.example.com/api/admin/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "session-cookie=..." \
  -d '{
    "username": "alice",
    "password": "her-password",
    "permissions": ["upload"]
  }'
```

**Permission values:**
- `"upload"` — can upload files
- `"admin"` — full admin access (implies upload access)

Users can have both: `["admin", "upload"]`.

## Running in production

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces an optimized Next.js build in `.next/`. The build uses webpack (Turbopack is disabled for production builds to avoid path-resolution issues in certain hosting environments).

### Start

```bash
npm run start
```

This starts the Next.js production server on port 3000 by default.

To use a different port:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm run start
```

### Required env vars at runtime

At minimum, set these before starting:

```bash
export GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
export AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export AUTH_URL=https://files.example.com
export DATABASE_PATH=/var/lib/fileshare/fileshare.db
export CLEANUP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
# If using a service account key:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/secrets/sa.json
```

### Process supervision with systemd

Create `/etc/systemd/system/fileshare.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Brushpass
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=fileshare
WorkingDirectory=/opt/fileshare
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node_modules/.bin/next start --webpack
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=PORT=3000
Environment=GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
Environment=AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
Environment=AUTH_URL=https://files.example.com
Environment=DATABASE_PATH=/var/lib/fileshare/fileshare.db
Environment=CLEANUP_SECRET=your-cleanup-secret
Environment=GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/secrets/sa.json

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable fileshare
systemctl start fileshare
journalctl -fu fileshare
```

### Process supervision with pm2

```bash
npm install -g pm2

pm2 start npm --name fileshare -- run start
pm2 save
pm2 startup  # follow the printed instructions to enable on boot
```

Or with an ecosystem file (`ecosystem.config.js`):

```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'fileshare',
    script: 'npm',
    args: 'run start',
    cwd: '/opt/fileshare',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      PORT: 3000,
      GCS_BUCKET: 'your-bucket-name',
      AUTH_SECRET: 'your-auth-secret',
      AUTH_URL: 'https://files.example.com',
      DATABASE_PATH: '/var/lib/fileshare/fileshare.db',
      CLEANUP_SECRET: 'your-cleanup-secret',
    },
  }],
};
```

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Reverse proxy with nginx

The app listens on HTTP. Put nginx in front for TLS termination:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name files.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/files.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/files.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # Increase for large file uploads — adjust to your needs
    client_max_body_size 500M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Required for streaming downloads — disable buffering
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name files.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

> **`AUTH_TRUST_HOST`:** If Auth.js logs warnings about untrusted hosts behind the proxy, set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` in your environment. This tells Auth.js to trust the `X-Forwarded-Host` header from the proxy.

### SQLite data directory

The SQLite database file must persist across restarts. Ensure the directory exists and is writable by the process user:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/fileshare
chown fileshare:fileshare /var/lib/fileshare
```

The app creates the database file and runs schema migrations automatically on first start.

---

## Deploy to GCP with Terraform

The `terraform/` directory contains the complete infrastructure definition for deploying to GCP Cloud Run. A single script handles everything: Docker build, Artifact Registry setup, all GCP resources, `AUTH_URL` configuration, and the initial admin bootstrap.

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) >= 1.6
- `gcloud` CLI authenticated: `gcloud auth application-default login`
- Docker with `buildx` support (for cross-platform ARM → AMD64 builds)

### Step 1 — Configure

```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Fill in: project_id, container_image, bucket names, bootstrap_admin_pass
```

### Step 2 — Deploy

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This single script:
1. Configures Docker auth for Artifact Registry
2. Imports the AR repo into Terraform state if it already exists
3. Builds and pushes the image (`linux/amd64`)
4. Runs `terraform init` and `terraform apply`
5. Patches `AUTH_URL` onto the service post-creation (via `gcloud run services update`)
6. Executes the bootstrap job to create the initial admin account

Use `./deploy.sh --plan` to see what Terraform would change without applying.

### Step 3 — Clean up bootstrap secrets

After verifying you can log in at the service URL, remove the temporary admin credentials:

```bash
gcloud secrets delete fileshare-admin-user --project=YOUR_PROJECT --quiet
gcloud secrets delete fileshare-admin-pass --project=YOUR_PROJECT --quiet
terraform state rm google_secret_manager_secret.admin_user
terraform state rm google_secret_manager_secret_version.admin_user
terraform state rm google_secret_manager_secret.admin_pass
terraform state rm google_secret_manager_secret_version.admin_pass
```

Then remove the `admin_user`/`admin_pass` resource blocks from `terraform/secrets.tf` and the `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS` env blocks from the bootstrap job in `terraform/cloudrun.tf`.

> The exact commands are also printed at the end of each `deploy.sh` run.

### Redeployments

For **code-only changes** (no infrastructure updates), use the faster redeploy script — it skips Terraform entirely:

```bash
./redeploy.sh
```

For **infrastructure changes** (new env vars, IAM, scaling, etc.), re-run the full deploy:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Notes

- **`max-instances=1`** is enforced at the Terraform level. SQLite on GCS FUSE does not support concurrent writers — do not increase this unless you migrate to Cloud SQL.
- **Terraform state** contains sensitive values (generated secrets). The default backend is local; switch to a GCS backend for team use (instructions in `terraform/main.tf`).
- **OIDC:** set `oidc_issuer`, `oidc_client_id`, and `oidc_client_secret` in `terraform.tfvars` and re-apply. All three must be non-empty to enable. The exact redirect URI to register with your IdP is printed as the `oidc_callback_url` output after apply. Optionally set `oidc_admin_domain` to auto-grant upload+admin to users from that email domain on first sign-in.

---

## Scheduled cleanup

The cleanup job deletes expired files from GCS and removes their records from SQLite. It does not run automatically — you must call it on a schedule.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/cleanup`
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {CLEANUP_SECRET}`

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLEANUP_SECRET" https://files.example.com/api/cleanup
# Response: {"deleted": 3, "errors": []}
```

**Schedule with cron:**

```cron
# Run cleanup every hour
0 * * * * curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" https://files.example.com/api/cleanup >> /var/log/fileshare-cleanup.log 2>&1
```

**Schedule with systemd timer:**

`/etc/systemd/system/fileshare-cleanup.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Fileshare cleanup job

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" https://files.example.com/api/cleanup
```

`/etc/systemd/system/fileshare-cleanup.timer`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run fileshare cleanup hourly

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```bash
systemctl enable --now fileshare-cleanup.timer
```

The cleanup job is idempotent — running it more frequently than necessary is safe. Errors deleting individual files (e.g. already-deleted GCS objects) are logged but do not abort the job; the response body includes an `errors` array with per-file failures.

---

## User management API

The admin UI at `/admin/users` covers most user management needs. For scripting or bootstrapping, the REST API is available to any session with `admin` permission.

### List users

```bash
GET /api/admin/users
```

### Create user

```bash
curl -X POST https://files.example.com/api/admin/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{
    "username": "alice",
    "password": "secure-password",
    "permissions": ["upload"]
  }'
```

Permissions: `["upload"]`, `["admin"]`, or `["admin", "upload"]`.
Returns 409 if the username already exists.

### Update user

```bash
PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}
# Body: { "username"?: string, "password"?: string, "permissions"?: string[] }
```

### Delete user

```bash
DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}
```

Returns 409 if you attempt to delete your own account.

---

## Changing configuration

### Change the GCS bucket

1. Update `GCS_BUCKET` in your environment.
2. Restart the server.
3. Note: files uploaded to the old bucket are not migrated. Their download links will break until the objects are manually copied to the new bucket with the same key names.

### Change AUTH_SECRET

Changing `AUTH_SECRET` invalidates all existing sessions — every logged-in user will be signed out on their next request. Rotate it like any session signing key: update the value and restart.

### Change CLEANUP_SECRET

Update the value in your environment and restart. Update any cron jobs or timers that use the old value.

### Change DATABASE_PATH

1. Stop the server.
2. Copy the existing database file to the new path: `cp old/fileshare.db new/fileshare.db`
3. Update `DATABASE_PATH` and restart.

Moving the database without copying it will start fresh with an empty database — all file records and users will be lost (the GCS objects remain, but there will be no metadata to serve them).

### Add or remove OIDC

To enable: set all three `AUTH_OIDC_*` vars and restart. The SSO button appears on the login page automatically.

To disable: unset (or leave empty) any one of the three vars and restart. The SSO button disappears. Existing sessions created via OIDC remain valid until they expire.
