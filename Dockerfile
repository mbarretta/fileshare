# Prune devDependencies out of the builder's node_modules before it's copied
# into the runner stage, in a dedicated intermediate stage so the pruned tree
# never has to be reconciled against COPY --from's own layer caching. `next
# start` still needs to load next.config.ts at boot (Next transpiles it via its
# own bundled SWC bindings, not the `typescript` package — verified empirically
# by booting this exact pruned image and confirming `typescript` is absent from
# node_modules yet `next start` still parses next.config.ts and serves `/`).

# prune. npm 12 (bundled with Node >= 26) blocks dependency install scripts
# not covered by package.json's `allowScripts` — with a WARNING and exit 0 —
# so `npm ci` can "succeed" while silently shipping better-sqlite3 with no
# compiled binding (exactly what broke every DB route in production on
# 2026-08-14). unrs-resolver is deliberately NOT allowlisted: it is dev-only
# lint tooling with a JS fallback and never reaches the runner image.
